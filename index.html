                <p class="justify">
                    Hey there! I'm Alireza Ghorbani. I'm passionate about machine learning, with a focus on enhancing
                    trust in AI through explainable models. My research and projects in NLP and Computer Vision have
                    allowed me to tackle their complexities, using state-of-the-art XAI methods to better understand
                    model behavior.
                    <br />
                    I'm also interested in IoT, Cloud Computing, and Big Data Analysis. My undergraduate studies
                    introduced me to key concepts, and I've gained hands-on experience with tools like Apache Spark,
                    Hadoop, Docker, and Kubernetes.
                    <br />
                    In addition, I specialize in full-stack web development using JavaScript frameworks like React.js
                    and Node.js, and I completed a software engineering internship during my undergraduate studies.

                        <p>
                            Domain adaptation is a crucial aspect of machine learning and artificial intelligence that
                            addresses the challenge of adapting a model trained on one domain to another domain with
                            varying data distribution. The primary objective of domain adaptation is to enhance the
                            performance of a model on a target domain by leveraging knowledge from a source domain. This
                            approach is particularly useful when there is limited labeled data available for the target
                            domain but abundant labeled data available for the source domain. Domain adaptation can be
                            applied in diverse areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, speech
                            recognition, and robotics. One of the most effective techniques for solving domain
                            adaptation problems is discriminative adversarial neural networks (DANN). By using DANN, I
                            have successfully addressed a common issue in computer vision, where the feature
                            distribution in the training dataset differs significantly from that in the test dataset. To
                            demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, I have implemented it on two datasets: Office
                            datasets and Vehicle classification dataset. Initially, I trained Resnet50 without domain
                            adaptation and then used DANN to showcase the improvement in model accuracy. The results
                            showed that DANN significantly improved the model's performance on the target domain by
                            effectively leveraging knowledge from the source domain.

                            Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package and deploy
                            applications in a consistent and portable way. It allows for easy management of dependencies
                            and simplifies the deployment process. Kubernetes, on the other hand, is an orchestration
                            tool that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
                            It provides a centralized way to manage containers across multiple hosts and can
                            automatically handle load balancing, scaling, and self-healing. Together, Docker and
                            Kubernetes provide a powerful platform for building, deploying, and managing modern
                            applications at scale. In this project I Developed Node.js APIs and MangoDB database as
                            microservices and dockerized them to communicate efficiently and built clusters in local
                            machine with Kind and managing them with kubernetes to provide web services.

                            MERN Full-stack web development at IUT IT Center taught us how to build web application.
                            MERN full stack web development refers to the use of four technologies: MongoDB, Express,
                            React, and Node.js. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents.
                            Express is a web application framework for Node.js that provides a set of tools and features
                            for building web applications. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces,
                            and Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment. Together, these technologies
                            enabled us to build scalable, efficient, and dynamic web applications from front-end to
                            back-end. MERN full stack web development is popular for its flexibility, scalability, and
                            ease of use.
